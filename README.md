## Object-Classification-using-Neural-Networks

### Introduction

The automatic classification of objects within images is a cornerstone task in the field  of computer vision. As the digital world expands and the production of image data surges, the capacity for rapid and accurate classification becomes paramount for a myriad of applications, spanning from automated surveillance to assistive technologies. Neural networks, due to their impressive ability to learn hierarchical representations, have become the go-to approach for addressing the challenges associated with object classification.

In the pursuit of advancing these classification capabilities, this research paper delves into the comparative analysis of various neural network models. The process began with a thorough preprocessing of the dataset, which involved normalizing the image scales, enhancing quality, and ensuring a homogenized feed into the subsequent models. Data augmentation followed, where Keras's ImageDataGenerator played a pivotal role in artificially inflating the dataset with modified images derived through transformations such as flipping, rotation, and zooming. This procedure is crucial, as it not only augments the quantity of data but also simulates a more comprehensive representation of real-world scenarios, aiding the models in developing a more robust understanding of the object classes.

Furthermore, the study explores the implementation of one-hot encoding—a technique that converts categorical class labels into a binary matrix representation—setting the stage for deploying categorical_crossentropy as the loss function during training. This technique is integral to facilitating the nuanced differentiation between classes in a multi-class classification setting and is essential for fine grained predictions.

A suite of neural network models were meticulously evaluated, beginning with a basic Artificial Neural Network and progressing to more complex Convolutional Neural Network architectures. Firstly, the performance of an ANN was assessed, and it was found to inadequately model the complexity inherent in image data. The investigation then shifted to CNNs, where both a model without batch normalization and one enhanced with batch normalization were analyzed. While both outperformed the ANN, intriguingly, contrary to conventional wisdom that complex architectures yield better results, the CNNs demonstrated commendable performance, surpassing even the sophisticated DenseNet121, especially in their consistency as denoted by the variance in accuracy and loss metrics.

This paper will present a detailed account of the experiment design, model selection, preprocessing and augmentation pipeline, and the comprehensive evaluation of these neural networks. The objective is not merely to showcase the superiority of one model over another but to derive insightful correlations between architecture nuances and the quality of object classification, underpinned by empirical evidence garnered from a series of controlled experiments.
